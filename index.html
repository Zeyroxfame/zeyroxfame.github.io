	<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
	<p>My username is Zeyroxfame. I am a 15 year old Canadian who is really interested into coding and basically anything related to computers, the internet, and how things work.</p>
	<p>I enjoy achievement hunting a lot, and obviously I like playing games. My favorite genres are:
	<ul>
	  <li>Platformers</li>
	  <li>RPGs, more precisely turn-based</li>
	  <li>Tower defenses</li>
	  <li>Incremental games</li>
	  <li>Strategy games</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now here are some games I like:</p>
	<!--Include the game links, with a drop down list or whatever to redirect to the right page, like free or paid, what game, what platform. This will require JavaScript-->
	<ul>
	  <li>The two Ori games</li>
	  <li>Pizza tower</li> <!--Try making a small Peppino image here-->
	  <li>The Epic Battle Fantasy series</li>
	  <li>The Bloons TD series, Including the Bloons series and anything related to it.</li>
	  <li>The Civilization games.</li>
	  <li>Super Mario Galaxy. The best 3d mario game.</li>
	  <!--Those lists might need to get removed and placed in another page so it looks better? Not sure, we will see.-->
	</ul>
    <!--Insert social media here later, such as discord server and shit-->
